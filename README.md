# CNN-Based-Image-Classifier
Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify group members from images. Designed a CNN with convolutional and dense layers, applied data preprocessing, augmentation, and regularization techniques. Optimized performance through hyperparameter tuning and evaluation on test sets.
