# **CNN-Based Group Member Classifier**

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify group members based on images. The dataset is structured into training and testing sets, and the model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## **Project Overview**
- **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Libraries Used**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset of group members, split into train and test sets
- **Goal**: Classify images of group members using deep learning techniques

## **Dataset Structure**
- **Train**: Used for model training
- **Test**: Used for model evaluation

## **Installation**
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
